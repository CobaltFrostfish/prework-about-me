      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I've been working in EMS for the last 14 years and it's been everything I've known and trained for since high school. As most of you may or may not know, EMS is a great
           and rewarding career, however it's also extremely tough, exhausting, and mentally challenging. Eventhough I thoroughly enjoyed working in medicine, the time had come for
           me to step away and look toward my future. I've always been around tech my whole life with my father being a web developer and a QA
            test engineer I figured it could be a great path for me as well. I'm also pretty sure I had internet and email in my childhood home before 
           most of my friends. Oops i think i dated my self a bit. Haha</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was originally born in Germany and was raised in a few different states (military brat) however I've been in Denver for the last 23 years.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>My hobbies include: hanging out with my wife and our super cute pitbull named Elvis, playing hockey, snowboarding, craft beer and brewery hopping, brewing beer,
         golf, hiking, camping, fishing, woodworking, and playing guitar. Just to name a few anyway. Haha</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>It would be amazing to be a security engineer or a CISO for a large or even fortune 500 company.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Thornton, CO</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to learn coding and become a developer so i can learn and understand the base fundementals of how the internet is structured. I evetually want to use this knowledge
         to hack my way into cyber security. Ahhhh...see what I did there ;-)</p>
